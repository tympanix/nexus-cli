# Checksum Validation Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of checksum validation in the Nexus CLI to follow SOLID principles.

## Problem Analysis

The original implementation had several issues violating SOLID principles:

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violations
- `nexus_download.go` contained checksum validation logic mixed with download operations
- Functions like `getExpectedChecksum` and `computeChecksum` were scattered across the download module
- Checksum-related code was tightly coupled with download functionality

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violations
- Adding new checksum algorithms required modifying existing functions
- Switch statements in multiple places made the code harder to extend
- No abstraction for different checksum algorithms

### Code Duplication
- Multiple functions performing similar checksum operations
- Repeated switch statements for algorithm selection
- Deprecated functions (`computeSHA1`) showing historical duplication

## Solution

We extracted checksum validation into a dedicated module using the Strategy pattern.

### New Architecture

#### 1. ChecksumValidator Interface
```go
type ChecksumValidator interface {
    Validate(filePath string, expected nexusapi.Checksum) (bool, error)
    Algorithm() string
}
```

#### 2. Implementation
- Created `internal/nexus/checksum.go` with the `checksumValidator` struct
- Implemented factory pattern with `NewChecksumValidator(algorithm string)`
- Each validator encapsulates:
  - Hash function creation
  - Checksum extraction from asset metadata
  - File validation logic

#### 3. Integration
- Updated `DownloadOptions` to include a `checksumValidator` field
- Modified `SetChecksumAlgorithm()` to initialize the validator
- Refactored `downloadAsset()` to use the validator interface

## Benefits

### SOLID Compliance

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: 
   - Checksum validation now has its own module
   - Clear separation of concerns between download and validation

2. **Open/Closed Principle**: 
   - New algorithms can be added without modifying existing code
   - Strategy pattern allows easy extension

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**: 
   - All validators are interchangeable through the interface
   - No behavior surprises when switching algorithms

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**: 
   - Minimal, focused interface with only necessary methods

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: 
   - Download code depends on the abstraction (interface), not concrete implementations

### Code Quality Improvements

- **Removed 54 lines of duplicate code**:
  - Eliminated `getExpectedChecksum()`
  - Eliminated `computeChecksum()`
  - Eliminated deprecated `computeSHA1()`
  - Eliminated `NewSHA1()` helper

- **Improved testability**:
  - Checksum validation can be tested independently
  - Added comprehensive test suite for checksum module

- **Cleaner imports**:
  - Removed crypto imports from `nexus_download.go`
  - Centralized all hash-related imports in `checksum.go`

- **Better error handling**:
  - Validation errors are now more descriptive
  - Algorithm validation happens at initialization

## Testing

### New Tests Added
- `TestNewChecksumValidator`: Tests validator factory with all algorithms
- `TestChecksumValidatorAlgorithm`: Tests algorithm property
- `TestChecksumValidatorValidate`: Tests validation with correct/incorrect checksums
- `TestChecksumValidatorValidateNonExistentFile`: Tests error handling

### Existing Tests
All existing tests pass without modification, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Migration Guide

### Before
```go
expectedChecksum := getExpectedChecksum(asset.Checksum, opts)
if expectedChecksum != "" {
    actualChecksum, err := computeChecksum(localPath, opts.ChecksumAlgorithm)
    if err == nil && strings.EqualFold(actualChecksum, expectedChecksum) {
        // File is valid
    }
}
```

### After
```go
if opts.checksumValidator != nil {
    valid, err := opts.checksumValidator.Validate(localPath, asset.Checksum)
    if err == nil && valid {
        // File is valid
    }
}
```

## Performance

No performance impact - the refactoring maintains the same algorithmic complexity while improving code organization.

## Future Enhancements

This refactoring enables several future improvements:

1. **Easy algorithm additions**: New hash algorithms can be added by implementing the strategy
2. **Custom validators**: Users could provide their own validation logic
3. **Parallel validation**: Multiple files could be validated concurrently
4. **Caching**: Checksum results could be cached for repeated validations
5. **Progress tracking**: Validation progress could be reported separately

## Conclusion

This refactoring demonstrates how applying SOLID principles can:
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Enable future extensions
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Increase testability

The checksum validation module is now a reusable, well-tested component that follows industry best practices.
